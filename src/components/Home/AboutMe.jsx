                        Hi! I'm Michelle, an 18 year-old student studying computer engineering at the University of Toronto with intended minors in AI and Finance.

                        I'm interested in the fields of software development, cyber security and Cloud, and I'm passionate about coding and project creation, specifically building projects that reflect my own perspectives. Ever since I was young

                        I have always approached learning and problem solving through my own unique lens. I never felt like I understood things the same way as other people.
                        That never stopped me though, as I developed an interest for software development, the backbone of our society today.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        For me, coding is not just about solving
                        logical problems, it's about learning and building at the crux where creativity and problem-solving intersect.
                        I strive to continuously iterate myself to create meaningful and impactful software for others.
                        <br></br>

                        Outside of tech, I am interested in music and staying active! I like to play badminton and recently started dancing. I can play three instruments
                        (piano, clarinet, alto saxophone), and listen to too many genres to count. I also like to play video games and binge-watching shows!
